<objective>
Fix critical bugs (model ID, validation schema) and enable Standard mode for Phase 2 dual-mode input.

Purpose: The gap detection pipeline, standard mode flow, and model selector already exist from Phase 1 forward-building, but contain three critical bugs and one disabled feature that block Phase 2 requirements. This plan fixes all blocking issues to make both modes and both model tiers functional.

Output: All five source files updated with bug fixes and feature enablement. Both Fast and Standard modes selectable and functional. Both Gemini 2.5 Flash and Gemini 3 Pro selectable with correct model IDs.

  <action>
  Fix the Gemini 3 Pro model ID bug across all three files, and enable Standard mode in the mode selector.

  **src/lib/ai/models.ts:**
  - Change the MODELS object key from `"gemini-3-pro"` to `"gemini-3-pro-preview"`
  - Change the `id` field inside from `"gemini-3-pro"` to `"gemini-3-pro-preview"`
  - Keep `name`, `description`, and `maxOutputTokens` unchanged
  - The `ModelId` type will automatically update since it's `keyof typeof MODELS`
  - Add a comment: `// Note: ID may change to "gemini-3-pro" when model reaches GA`

  **src/components/generation/model-selector.tsx:**
  - Change the `id` field in the models array from `"gemini-3-pro"` to `"gemini-3-pro-preview"`
  - Keep `name: "Gemini 3 Pro"` and other fields unchanged

  **src/components/generation/mode-selector.tsx:**
  - Change Standard mode's `disabled` from `true` to `false`
  - Change Standard mode's `badge` from `"Coming Soon" as string | null` to `null as string | null`
  </action>
  <verify>
  Run `npm run build` — must pass with zero errors (TypeScript will catch any model ID string mismatches if types are used elsewhere).
  Run `npm run lint` — must pass clean.
  Grep for any remaining `gemini-3-pro"` (without `-preview`) across src/ to ensure no stale references.
  Grep for `Coming Soon` across src/ to ensure badge is removed.
  Grep for `disabled: true` in mode-selector.tsx to ensure standard mode is enabled.
  </verify>
  <done>
  The MODELS config uses `gemini-3-pro-preview` as both key and id. The model-selector.tsx uses `gemini-3-pro-preview` as the id. Standard mode is enabled in mode-selector.tsx (disabled: false, badge: null). No stale `gemini-3-pro` references remain in src/. Build and lint pass clean.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Fix validation schemas and standard mode UX</name>
  <files>
    src/lib/validation/generation.ts
    src/components/generation/standard-mode-flow.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
  Fix the validation schema to allow standard mode submissions, update model ID enums, and add required-question enforcement and minimum-answer warning to standard mode flow.

  **src/lib/validation/generation.ts:**
  - Remove `.min(50, ...)` from the `brainDump` field in `GenerationRequestSchema`. Keep `.max(15000, ...)`.
  - Add a `.refine()` to the entire `GenerationRequestSchema` object that conditionally enforces `brainDump.length >= 50` only when `mode === "fast"`. Use this exact pattern:
    ```
    .refine(
      (data) => {
        if (data.mode === "fast") {
          return data.brainDump.length >= 50;
        }
        return true;
      },
      {
        message: "Please provide at least 50 characters to generate a meaningful FRD",
        path: ["brainDump"],
      },
    )
    ```
  - Note: `.refine()` is safe here because this schema validates API input, NOT Gemini structured output.
  - Update `modelId` enum in `GenerationRequestSchema` from `["gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-3-pro"]` to `["gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-3-pro-preview"]`
  - Update `modelId` enum in `GapDetectionRequestSchema` from `["gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-3-pro"]` to `["gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-3-pro-preview"]`

  **src/components/generation/standard-mode-flow.tsx:**
  - Add a `requiredUnanswered` state check in `handleNext()`: When the current question is `required: true` and the answer is empty/whitespace-only, do NOT advance. Instead, show inline validation feedback. Add a state variable `showRequiredWarning` (boolean). When `handleNext` is called on a required question with no answer, set `showRequiredWarning` to true. Reset it when the user types or navigates. Display a `<p className="text-sm text-red-500 mt-1">This question is required</p>` below the textarea when `showRequiredWarning` is true.
  - Keep the Skip button hidden for required questions (existing behavior is correct).
  - In `handleFinish()`, before calling `onSubmit`, check `answeredCount`. If `answeredCount < 2`, show a non-blocking warning. Add a `showMinAnswerWarning` state. When finish is called with < 2 answers, set `showMinAnswerWarning` to true and return without submitting. Render a warning banner: `<div className="rounded-lg bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 p-3 text-sm text-amber-700">For best results, answer at least 2 questions. <button onClick={forceSubmit}>Generate anyway</button></div>`. The "Generate anyway" button calls `onSubmit` directly, bypassing the warning. This satisfies STND-02 (user can still skip) while preventing low-quality FRDs.
  </action>
  <verify>
  Run `npm run build` — must pass with zero errors.
  Run `npm run lint` — must pass clean.
  Verify the GenerationRequestSchema allows `{ mode: "standard", brainDump: "" }` by reading the schema structure.
  Verify the GenerationRequestSchema still rejects `{ mode: "fast", brainDump: "short" }` by reading the refine logic.
  Verify both modelId enums contain `gemini-3-pro-preview`.
  </verify>
  <done>
  GenerationRequestSchema accepts empty brainDump when mode is "standard" and rejects brainDump under 50 chars when mode is "fast". Both modelId enums use "gemini-3-pro-preview". StandardModeFlow enforces required questions (cannot advance without answering) and shows a non-blocking warning when fewer than 2 questions are answered before generation, with a "Generate anyway" escape hatch. Build and lint pass clean.
  </done>

1. `npm run build` passes with zero errors
2. `npm run lint` passes with zero errors
3. No remaining `gemini-3-pro"` references (without `-preview`) in src/ — run: `grep -r '"gemini-3-pro"' src/`
4. No remaining `Coming Soon` in mode-selector.tsx
5. Standard mode `disabled: false` in mode-selector.tsx
6. `GenerationRequestSchema` has `.refine()` for conditional brainDump validation
7. Both `GenerationRequestSchema` and `GapDetectionRequestSchema` use `gemini-3-pro-preview` in modelId enum
8. `StandardModeFlow` has required-question enforcement in `handleNext()`
9. `StandardModeFlow` has minimum-answer warning in `handleFinish()`

<success_criteria>
- Both Fast and Standard modes are selectable in the UI (no disabled state, no badge)
- Gemini 3 Pro uses the correct model ID `gemini-3-pro-preview` across all layers (server config, client selector, validation schemas)
- Standard mode requests with empty brainDump pass validation; Fast mode requests with < 50 chars fail validation
- Standard mode enforces required questions and warns on low answer count
- Build and lint pass clean
</success_criteria>

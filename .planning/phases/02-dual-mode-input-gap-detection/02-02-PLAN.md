<objective>
Add comprehensive tests for Phase 2 functionality: validation schemas, standard mode flow, and model selector.

Purpose: Phase 2 enables existing but untested code (gap detection, standard mode, model selection). Tests verify the bug fixes from Plan 02-01 are correct and prevent regressions. The validation schema tests are particularly important since they verify the conditional brainDump logic that differentiates fast vs standard mode.

Output: Three test files covering validation schemas, standard mode flow, and model selector. All tests pass via `npm test`.

    tests/lib/validation/generation.test.ts
  </files>
  <action>
  Create test file for `GenerationRequestSchema` and `GapDetectionRequestSchema` using Vitest. Import from `@/lib/validation/generation`. Use `describe`/`it` blocks.

  **RED phase — write these tests first (they should all pass against the fixed code from 02-01):**

  `describe("GenerationRequestSchema")`:
  1. `it("accepts fast mode with brainDump >= 50 chars")` — parse a valid fast mode request with 50+ char brainDump. Expect success.
  2. `it("rejects fast mode with brainDump < 50 chars")` — parse a fast mode request with 10 char brainDump. Expect ZodError with path `["brainDump"]`.
  3. `it("accepts standard mode with empty brainDump")` — parse a valid standard mode request with `brainDump: ""` and `guidedAnswers: [{section: "Overview", question: "...", answer: "..."}]`. Expect success.
  4. `it("accepts standard mode with missing brainDump")` — parse standard mode with `brainDump: ""`. Expect success (no guidedAnswers required by schema, just empty brainDump allowed).
  5. `it("rejects brainDump over 15000 chars")` — parse with a 15001 char brainDump. Expect ZodError.
  6. `it("accepts modelId gemini-2.5-flash")` — parse with `modelId: "gemini-2.5-flash"`. Expect success.
  7. `it("accepts modelId gemini-3-pro-preview")` — parse with `modelId: "gemini-3-pro-preview"`. Expect success.
  8. `it("rejects modelId gemini-3-pro (without -preview)")` — parse with `modelId: "gemini-3-pro"`. Expect ZodError.
  9. `it("defaults modelId to undefined when not provided")` — parse without modelId field. Expect success, result.modelId is undefined.

  `describe("GapDetectionRequestSchema")`:
  10. `it("accepts valid gap detection request")` — parse with projectName, brainDump (50+ chars). Expect success.
  11. `it("accepts modelId gemini-3-pro-preview")` — Expect success.
  12. `it("rejects modelId gemini-3-pro (without -preview)")` — Expect ZodError.

  Use a helper function for the base valid request to avoid repetition:
  ```typescript
  const validFastRequest = {
    projectId: "test-project-id",
    projectName: "Test Project",
    brainDump: "A".repeat(50),
    mode: "fast" as const,
  };
  ```

  **GREEN phase:** Tests should pass against the fixed code from 02-01. If any fail, investigate — the fix in 02-01 may need adjustment.

  **REFACTOR phase:** Clean up any duplication in test helpers.
  </action>
  <verify>
  Run `npx vitest run tests/lib/validation/generation.test.ts` — all tests pass.
  Verify test count matches expected (12 tests).
  </verify>
  <done>
  12 validation schema tests pass, covering: conditional brainDump validation (fast mode enforces min 50, standard mode allows empty), modelId enum (accepts gemini-3-pro-preview, rejects gemini-3-pro), and basic field validation. Tests import from the actual validation module and use real Zod parsing.

    tests/components/generation/standard-mode-flow.test.tsx

  </files>
  <action>
  Create component test files using Vitest + React Testing Library (@testing-library/react). If `@testing-library/react` is not installed, install it along with `@testing-library/jest-dom` as dev dependencies. Check `package.json` first.

  **tests/components/generation/standard-mode-flow.test.tsx:**

  Import `StandardModeFlow` from `@/components/generation/standard-mode-flow`. Use `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent` from `@testing-library/react`.

  `describe("StandardModeFlow")`:
  1. `it("renders first question with progress bar")` — render component, verify question text visible, progress bar visible, "Question 1 of 8" text.
  2. `it("advances to next question on Next click when answer provided")` — type in textarea, click Next, verify "Question 2 of 8" visible.
  3. `it("blocks advancement on required question with no answer")` — on first question (required), click Next without typing. Verify "This question is required" warning appears. Verify still on "Question 1 of 8".
  4. `it("hides Skip button for required questions")` — on first question (required), verify Skip button is NOT in the document. Navigate to a non-required question (e.g., question 5 "secondary-features"), verify Skip button IS visible.
  5. `it("shows Skip button for optional questions")` — navigate to question 5 (first optional), verify Skip button present.
  6. `it("shows minimum answer warning when submitting with < 2 answers")` — answer only question 1, navigate to last question, click Generate FRD. Verify warning banner appears with "at least 2 questions" text.
  7. `it("allows forced submit via Generate anyway button")` — trigger the warning, then click "Generate anyway". Verify `onSubmit` was called.
  8. `it("submits directly when >= 2 answers provided")` — answer questions 1 and 2, navigate to last, click Generate FRD. Verify `onSubmit` called without warning.
  9. `it("collects only non-empty answers in submission")` — answer questions 1, 2, 3, skip 4-8. Verify `onSubmit` called with exactly 3 GuidedAnswer objects.

  Use `vi.fn()` for `onSubmit` prop. Use `isSubmitting: false` for all tests.

  **tests/components/generation/model-selector.test.tsx:**

  Import `ModelSelector` from `@/components/generation/model-selector`.

  `describe("ModelSelector")`:
  1. `it("renders both model options")` — render with `value="gemini-2.5-flash"`. Verify "Gemini 2.5 Flash" and "Gemini 3 Pro" text visible.
  2. `it("highlights selected model")` — render with `value="gemini-2.5-flash"`. Verify Flash button has selected styling class. Verify Pro does not.
  3. `it("calls onChange with correct model ID on click")` — click Gemini 3 Pro button. Verify `onChange` called with `"gemini-3-pro-preview"`.
  4. `it("uses gemini-3-pro-preview as the Pro model ID")` — render, click Pro button. Verify onChange called with `"gemini-3-pro-preview"` (not `"gemini-3-pro"`).

  **GREEN phase:** All tests should pass against the fixed code from 02-01.

  **REFACTOR phase:** Extract shared render helpers if there is duplication.

  Run `npx vitest run tests/components/` — all tests pass.
  Verify test counts: ~9 standard mode tests, ~4 model selector tests.
  Run `npm test` — full test suite passes (includes both test files plus validation tests from Task 1).
  </verify>
  <done>
  13 component tests pass covering: StandardModeFlow (progress rendering, required question enforcement, skip button visibility, minimum answer warning with escape hatch, answer collection) and ModelSelector (rendering, selection highlighting, correct model ID on click). All tests use React Testing Library and verify actual user interactions.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. `npm test` passes with zero failures
2. At least 25 total tests across all three files
3. Validation tests cover: fast mode brainDump min, standard mode brainDump bypass, modelId enum, max length
4. Standard mode tests cover: required question enforcement, skip visibility, minimum answer warning, forced submit
5. Model selector tests cover: rendering both options, correct model ID passed on click
6. `npm run build` still passes (tests don't break build)
7. `npm run lint` still passes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All Phase 2 tests pass via `npm test`
- Tests verify the critical bug fixes from Plan 02-01 (model ID, brainDump validation, standard mode)
- Tests document expected behavior for future developers
- No test relies on mocked validation — uses real Zod schemas
- Build and lint pass clean

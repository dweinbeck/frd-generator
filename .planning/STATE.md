## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Auth deferred to Phase 4 per platform-infra dependency; architecture accommodates auth from Phase 1
- Firestore subcollection data model (projects/{id}/versions/{id}) designed from day one to avoid 1 MiB limit
- Gemini structured output enforcement from Phase 1 to prevent format inconsistency across generations
- [01-01] Accepted pre-existing scaffolding; verified and aligned with plan requirements
- [01-01] createProject takes userId as parameter (more flexible than hardcoded anonymous); TODO for Phase 4
- [01-01] brainDump min(50) validation added to GenerationRequestSchema

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Platform-infra Firebase Auth must be ready before Phase 4 begins
